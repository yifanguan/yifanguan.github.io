It is very interesting to make one's own GH60-RevCHN keyboard since it is completely open-source from hardware to software. The article is a guide to show how to configure the GH60 in software on Mac OS X.

## What we use

- [keyboard-layout-editor.com](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) to make layout.
- [TMK Keymap Generator](https://tkg.io) to generate `keymap.eep`.
- [tkg toolkit](https://github.com/kairyu/tkg-toolkit) to reflash the keyboard.

## Make your own keyboard layout

You can design it by yourself and mine is a combination of HHKB and mac since the keyboard is used on my mbp.

```
[{a:0},"Esc\n\n\n\n~\n`",{a:4},"!\n1\n\n\nF1","@\n2\n\n\nF2","#\n3\n\n\nF3","$\n4\n\n\nF4","%\n5\n\n\nF5","^\n6\n\n\nF6","&\n7\n\n\nF7","*\n8\n\n\nF8","(\n9\n\n\nF9",")\n0\n\n\nF10","_\n-\n\n\nF11","+\n=\n\n\nF12",{w:2},"Backspace\n\n\n\nDelete"],
[{w:1.5},"Tab","Q","W\n\n\n\n↑","E","R","T","Y\n\n\n\nCalc","U","I\n\n\n\nIns","O","P\n\n\n\nPSc","{\n[\n\n\nScrLk",{a:0},"}\n]\n\n\nPus\nBrk",{a:4,w:1.5},"|\n\\"],
[{w:1.75},"Ctrl","A\n\n\n\n←","S\n\n\n\n↓","D\n\n\n\n→","F","G","H","J","K","L",":\n;\n\n\nHome","\"\n'\n\n\nPgUp",{w:2.25},"Enter"],
[{w:2.25},"Shift","Z","X\n\n\n\nApp","C\n\n\n\nFn2","V\n\n\n\nFn1","B\n\n\n\nFn3","N\n\n\n\nVolDn","M\n\n\n\nVolUp","<\n,\n\n\nMute",">\n.\n\n\nEnd","?\n/\n\n\nPgDn",{w:2.75},"RShift"],
[{w:1.25},"Win",{w:1.25},"Alt",{w:1.25},"Win",{w:6.25},"Space",{w:1.25},"RAlt",{w:1.25},"Fn0",{w:1.25},"Caps Lock",{w:1.25},"RCtrl"]
```

You can copy this raw data into keyboard-layout-editor and try to modify it.

## Convert the json to `keymap.eep`

Just use TMK Keymap Generator and choose `simple`. You need specify the function of Fn. Download `eep` file.

## Reflash the keyboard

Use tkg-toolkit. Remember to click on the flash key on your keyboard.

```
brew install libusb-compat
cd mac
./setup.sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
./reflash.sh ./keymap.eep
```

That's all.
