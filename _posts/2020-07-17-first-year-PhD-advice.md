# 1-D model
Keep moving. This is probably not a good idea. Direction is fixed.

# N-D model
Move at a good pace, stop, and look around.
Pointing to a correct direction is important.
One of the only way to develop intuition is starting doing things around it or in it.

# Advisor meetings
Talk about a concrete thing.
- notes about experiments
- theory/paper draft
- software prototype
- graphs, figures 

# Twelve sticky notes
- Start simple
- Look at raw data
- Be concrete
- Incremental results
- Find something interesting
- Push hard on clean signals
- Actionable
- Comparative advantage is key
- Find solid levers to pull
- Document successes and failures (YG: Personally, I learned this from my labmates.)
- Inspect outliers
- Eliminate sources of bias
