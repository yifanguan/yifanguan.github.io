We need to have a shared ethical framework.

# Week 1
### What are Ethics?
Nowadays, Data Science is young field. Big Data has a large impact on society. We are on the way to figure out the impact. 
Having other data scientists think about ethics in our field. 
We haven't had soceital agreement about ethics in data science. 
Ethics are shared rules we all agree to follow because of the resulting benefits. 
There is virtually no limit to what Data Science could do with data. 

Important: identify shared value

### History, Concept of Informed Consent
The Tuskegee experiment: uninformed consent

Informed consent: (1) human subject must be informed about the experiment. (2) must consent to the experiment without any coercion (3) must have the right to withdraw consent at any time 

A key principle of informed consent is that the party that might potentially be harmed is the one who has to decide that on balance between risk to them and benefit to society.

Institutional Review Board (IRB): (1) balance potential harm to subjects against benefits  (2) make sure informed consent principle is properly followed (3) comprised of scientists and non-scientists (4) exception of informed consent in psychology

Prospective data collection is only required for research, not required for business. 
- A/B testing
- However, companies should not lie to us intentionally

Repurposing can be problematic. Data collected is given permission in a particular context. The context matters and you may not use it in any other context or sell it to somebody else. 
However, repurposing data is not all bad. 
- Credit card company -> credit agency (ecosystem)
- medical data is repurposed for medical research. However, the specific research questions may not be known at the time medical care is received (retrospective data analysis). 

Case study of OkCupid: OkCupid decided to try an experiment where they wanted to understand the impact on the success of a date of simply being told that you are compatible. What they did was took people who were actually not very compatible, had a low compatibility score, and falsely told them that they had a high compatibility score just to bring people together. Conversely, they also took people who had a high compatibility score and told them they had a low compatibility score. 
Having a company intentionally lie to you, intentially give you a wrong score is something that most people would consider socially unacceptable. 

### Data Ownership
The data is about you, but is the data yours?

Intellectual Property Basics
- Copyright (1. artistic expression 2. A rearrangement is a derivative work) More related to data ownership
- Patent (Idea for making or doing)
- Trade Secret (I have it, but don't tell anyone)

If I use your data, I am almost always taking some piece of what you know, merging it with what I know, and expressing something new. (1. At best, I can say I used some data from you 2. Not easy to say exactly what and exactly how much)

digitized data can preserve culture, propagate culture

data collection and curation: lots of effort to collect, clean, validate, and standardize data to place it into a form that is of immediate value. Whoever does this work deserves credit, and has onwership of the data asset

You could have data that people freely gave you, and then you could put it all together and the effort of putting it all together still gives you ownership. 
Crowd-sourced reputation sites such as Yelp or TripAdvisor, companies like this all completely have their business model reliant upon people in the community expressing their opinion about businesses that they're rating on these sites. These opinions are freely contributed by people. The key point whether the contributors are compensated or not is that the data that get collected are then the property of these data collectors and aggregators. And it is their collection and their organization and the effort that they put in to create this collection that is a thing that induces value, and they are free to sell ads, or make money off of this data in whatever manner they see fit.

There is a strong reason to record data, but also potential for misuse.
Prefer to limit use, not recording. 
Voluntary limits on use
Government surveillance

Data destruction: collected data must be destroyed, not sold once the company ceases to do business

Data ownership is complex. For the most part, you do not own data about you. Data about us that somebody else has collected, is owned by whoever collected it. For privacy, have some control over these data that aren't ours, because they're about us. We need to create the principles to reason about this control.
