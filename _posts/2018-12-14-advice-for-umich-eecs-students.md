Since I'm one CS student. My advice targets at the CS major.

## Course Selection Advice
To begin, [EECS Undergraduate Workload Survey Results](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/undergraduate/survey/) could give you a general idea of workload of each course. However, sense of workload varies from person to person. Below I will give you my suggestions based on courses I have taken. I have taken EECS 280, EECS 281, EECS 370, EECS 376, EECS 388, EECS 442, EECS 445, EECS 482, EECS 484, EECS 485, and EECS 595.

My general advice is to take at most two EECS courses in every semester. The reason is simple. There is a lot you need to study in each area beyond course materials covered. Each course only gives you the ability to open a door of an area. How far you can go is dependent on your effort.

Let me give you a solid recommendation. Let assume you take EECS280 at your second semester at the University of Michigan. 
I recommend you to take EECS 281 and EECS 370 in third semester. I recommend to take EECS 376 after EECS 281, EECS 370. It is doable to take it along with EECS 281, EECS 370. However, I think EECS 376 covers a different range of topics. It may not match your senses of worlds at the beginning. On the other hands, it it curcial to spend time strengthen you knowledge in EECS 281 and EECS 370. They will be useful all the time.

In your fourth semester, I recommend you to take EECS 484 and EECS 376. I highly recommend take EECS 484 as the first upper-level course you should take. It covers SQLs in the first half of semester, which is helpful and useful for EECS 485. It also covers system related topics in the second half of semester, which is useful for EECS 482 and EECS 485. Taking EECS 484 first will reduce your burden in the future. EECS 376 covers algorithms related stuff in the frist 1/3 semester. EECS 281 will be helpful during this time. EECS 376 will cover cyptography in its last 1/3 semester, which will be helpful for EECS388 and EECS 475. I like this part of EECS 376 best. It covers clear mathmatics. As long as you put time, you will thank youself in the future.

In the fifth semester, I recommend you to take EECS 388 and EECS 485. Both of those two courses cover web-related knowledge. You also have enough knowledge to succeed in them. With EECS 370, EECS 376 and EECS 484, crypograph, SQL injections, Bufferoverflow will be much easier. Many materials covered in EECS388 can also help you understand materials in EECS 485, such as Tor, SQL injections, etc. EECS 485 also covers a lot of systems degisn stuff, which I think will help you understand 482.

At this point, you can take whateverv courses you want to take, you should have enough skills you need to succeed. 

If you want to take AI related courses, I recommend you to take EECS 445 first. The math and stats covered in it are thoroghful. They will help both EECS 442 (Computer Vision) and EECS 595 (NLP). 
You see the stacks I build up for you, right? It may not be the fastest way to take your favorite courses. However, this schedule is the least stressful and most organized schedule. Please take my opinions into consideration. You can make your own schedule based on the provided schedule.

## Research Advice
[SURE program](https://sure.engin.umich.edu/) is a good summer research opportunity for you. I recommend you to apply for your junior summer. At that time, you will have enough skills to take more ownership of one research project. It is also important to contact professors after you submit your application. Positions are limited. You have to show your ambitions.
If you are interested in one area after taking one upper-level course with one professor, you could ask him/her to join his/her lab. This is what I did. Or you could send emails to professors whose projects you are interested in. You can find projects information on their websites. Do your researches of what professors are currently doing is important. Do not  This is also what I did.
I highly recommend you to only do one research at a time.

## Internship Advice
# Get interview
Umich Career Fair is a great resource to utilize. You can find out information online or ask other senior students about which company will have on-campus interviews. Your targets on career fair should be those company having on-campus interview opportunities. Microsoft is one example. For those companies who do not have on-campus interviews, my suggestion is to spend your time on median or small size companies, such as Pure Storage. Those companies could give you phone interviews if you hand out your resume to them. I highly discourage you to waste your time on queue for big companies, such as Google and Facebook. First, it takes you roughly three hours to have a five-minute talk with recruiters. Second, finding employee to refer you is best option for those companies.
The most important thing is to find employee in your target companys to refer you for internship positions. Personally, I recommend you to use Linkedin. It takes time to find someone willing to refer you. Please be patient.
A side note for students interested in pursuing a Ph.D., I highly recommend you to get a internship job in your freshman or sophomore summer. Those technical skills you gain from internships will help you get research positions in labs. Also, you could get a sense of industrial experience. Junior Summer is a valuable time for you to do research because you will have essential and enough skills to have great impacts on research projects and get strong recommendations from professors.

# Prepare for interview
[Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com/) is a great platform to help you prepare for technical interviews. I high recommend you to buy its yearly premium membership. With premium membership, you could practice technical interview questions based on company tags. 
It's also important to express your ideas efficiently. During your interviews, you need to convey your solutions to interviewers.

## Conclusion
I hope my bolg could help you to succeed at the University of Michigan. In my opinion, peer advice is sometimes the most important part. When I look back now, I feel there is a lot of places I could have done better. However, my limitations at that time restrict myself. I hope other students can reduce more or less their disappointments with my advice.
