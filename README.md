# JasonQSY.github.io

My personal website has been rewritten. It has been migrated from pelican to Jekyll. The old code can be found at `legacy` branch.

## Environment

We need `rust` and `gem`.

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

## Development

We use `_config_dev.yml` for development. Just type

```bash
jekyll serve --config _config_dev.yml
```

## Deploy

Just push to the Github repo.

## Reference

The website is powered by Jekyll.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The framework.
